"""Checks that a PR's roadmap issues are linked and up to date before it merges.

For every story the PR names (`Roadmap story: E1-S2`, comma-separated for more):
- the PR references the story's issue with `Closes #n` or `Part of #n`
- the issue is open, is a sub-issue of its epic and has the epic's milestone
- the issue's AC lines match the roadmap text (ticks ignored), so the issue isn't stale
- a closing PR leaves no unticked AC or task boxes in the issue
And: no roadmap issue is referenced without its story, and no epic is closed by a PR.

Ticked boxes are claims; the roadmap-review agent checks them against the diff.

Env: REPO, GH_TOKEN, PR_BODY or PR_BODY_FILE. ROADMAP overrides the roadmap path.
Exit 1 on any problem, listing all of them.
