# Payer architecture

How the payer side (a fictional health plan, **Praxis Health Plan**) sits next to the existing clinic, and how the two talk through the Da Vinci IGs. For the goal and backlog, see the [roadmap](roadmap/payer-davinci.md). Decisions and their trade-offs are in [`docs/adr/`](adr/).

## 1. The two sides

![Payer and provider architecture](diagrams/payer-architecture.png)

| Layer | Provider side (exists) | Payer side (new) |
|---|---|---|
| UI | clinician-app, patient-app | payer-app: utilization management (UM) reviewer |
| API | clinic-api :9090: JSON for its apps, and the **client** of the payer's Da Vinci APIs | payer-api :9095: `/fhir` interop **server**, `/cds-services` (CRD), `/oauth/token`, `/api` JSON for payer-app |
| FHIR store | provider HAPI :8080 (database `hapi`) | payer HAPI :8081 (database `hapi_payer`, IG packages loaded) |
| Storage | one PostgreSQL 15 container | |

The two sides share nothing but HTTP. A patient in the clinic and a member at the payer are different FHIR resources in different servers, linked by the member id on `Coverage`. This mirrors real life and is why Payer-to-Payer needs `$member-match` ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-separate-payer-service.md)).

## 2. Who calls whom

| From → to | Call | IG |
|---|---|---|
| clinic-api → payer-api | `POST /cds-services/{hook}` on order sign and appointment book | CRD |
| clinic-api → payer-api | `Questionnaire/$questionnaire-package` | DTR |
| clinic-api → payer-api | `Claim/$submit`, `Claim/$inquire` | PAS |
| payer HAPI → clinic-api | rest-hook on `ClaimResponse` change (shared secret) | PAS notification |
| payer-api → clinic-api | `POST /fhir/Task` (attachment request) | CDex |
| clinic-api → payer-api | `Claim/$submit-attachment` | CDex |
| clinic-api → payer-api | Patient Access reads (member token), `Group/{id}/$export` (Provider Access) | PDex, ATR |
| other payer → payer-api | `Patient/$member-match`, then a member-scoped `$export` | PDex, HRex |
| anyone → payer-api | Plan-Net and Formulary search, no auth | Plan-Net, Formulary |

## 3. Inside payer-api

```
payer-api/src/main/java/.../payer/
  interop/     HAPI RestfulServer + resource/operation providers: FHIR in, FHIR out
  cdshooks/    CRD discovery and hook handlers (CDS Hooks JSON with FHIR resources inside)
  controller/  JSON endpoints for payer-app (DTOs only)
  service/     business logic: CoverageRuleService, Adjudicator, SlaClock, MemberService, …
  mapper/      FHIR ↔ DTO
  dto/         Java records
  security/    staff roles, SMART scopes, ScopeInterceptor, member compartment
  config/      FhirConfig (payer HAPI client), RestfulServerConfig, SecurityConfig
```

Rules enforced by ArchUnit ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-fhir-at-the-payer-boundary.md)):

- `org.hl7.fhir.*` types are allowed in `interop`, `cdshooks`, `mapper` and `service`, and never in `controller` or `dto`.
- Data access goes through the payer HAPI via the shared `IGenericClient`. Nothing talks to Postgres directly.

clinic-api gets two additions:

- A `client` package with `CrdClient`, `DtrClient`, `PasClient`, `CdexClient` and `PdexClient`, each calling payer-api. Calls are wrapped by services, and controllers still see DTOs only.
- An `interop` package with one inbound FHIR endpoint, `POST /fhir/Task`, for CDex attachment requests, authenticated with a payer system token.

## 4. What we reuse instead of building

| Need | Reused |
|---|---|
| Bulk export for Provider Access and Payer-to-Payer | HAPI JPA `$export` (`hapi.fhir.bulk_export_enabled`). payer-api only authorizes the request and proxies it. |
| Profile validation | HAPI `$validate` against the IG packages loaded into the payer HAPI; the HL7 validator CLI in CI |
| Decision notifications | rest-hook `Subscription`, the same pattern as the high BP alerts (`HighBpAlertService`, `AlertController`) |
| Auth | clinic-api's `JwtConfig`, `TokenService` and `RolePermissions` patterns; `libs/auth` in payer-app |
| Seeding and e2e | `apps/seed-demo-data`, `libs/e2e-support` |

## 5. Implementation guides

The pinned versions are recorded here in E0-S2, after checking packages.fhir.org:

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| hl7.fhir.us.core | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-hrex | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-crd | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-dtr | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-pas | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-cdex | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-pdex | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.carin-bb | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-pdex-plan-net | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-drug-formulary | _tbd_ |
| hl7.fhir.us.davinci-atr | _tbd_ |

## 6. Out of scope

- X12 278 translation ([ADR 0004](adr/0004-fhir-pas-without-x12.md)).
- Real claims adjudication and payment. `ExplanationOfBenefit` history is seeded.
- Production-grade identity (UDAP dynamic registration, a real IdP). Tokens come from payer-api itself ([ADR 0006](adr/0006-payer-auth.md)).
